Changes in Requirements:
	-Mention that timeout is now in milliseconds, given how long it takes
	-Timeout Customizable
	-Utility Interval instead of Equality
	-New Parameters
	-Mention the "DRAW" Utility as another Evaluation parameter
	Changes to Rules-Based Computer Player:
		The initial configuration of Utility for the Players made them timid - the Guerilla did not 
		want to place pieces in corners of COIN Checkers unless they were between COIN 
		Checkers (which meant that the COIN would always win due to the Guerilla running out of pieces

Implementation:
	-Mention GameStateAnalyzer
	-Create Class Diagrams for every class (with signals)
	-Mention Godot's use of Signals as the Observer pattern
	-Discuss limitation of Experiment - Random Seed does NOT set (was found later in project), so the
	results are NOT reproducible, therefore the setting of a Random Seed was removed
	-Do flowchart, UML, text planning also suitable
	-For modelling the game itself, go for class diagram, 
	and write UML diagram of main classes - would be useful in dissertation, to explain how things are developed
	-Copy in UML Diagrams
	-Categorize UML Diagrams appropriately
	-Discuss how there was a bug found - when there is no Minimax Profiles in existence, the User
	cannot play Minimax. This, however, provided an extra avenue - experimenting with Different
	Minimax Profiles meant the possibility of creating "Default" Minimax Profiles built into the game,
	so that the User may play with them.
	(e.g. "Easy", "Medium", "Hard")
	-Mention the presence of a Memory Leak (for the Game State) with no obvious way to fix it, 
	despite switching to Godot's Resource Type which purports to be automatically freed when there
	are no references to a resource.
	-Mention the reason for the memory leak - the "Move" Class extended "Object", and since many thousands
	of moves were being analyzed my Minimax without being freed, this led to HUGE Memory usage.
	This was fixed by making Move extend the Resource Class, which is automatically freed.

Tuning Step:
	-Discuss next stage of tuning - two placements counting as one move for the Guerilla, and its
	ramifications
	-Discuss Intervals of Utility (by default 1, so all moves of utility within 1 or -1 are considered equal),
	and mention how this could be something for future analysis. They would be another interesting 
	parameter to tune. Explain how this was chosen partly for more variation of movements, and also
	because, according to Godot, exact equality between floating point numbers (which are the utilities)
	is impossible to find

Project Plan Discussion:
	-Mention that there was a "Dissertation Plan.txt" to which things were added as they came up, providing useful reminders for actual
	thesis writing.

General:
	-Aim to get best-performing combination of Minimax Parameters
	-Add page numbers
	-Upload into the repo (at the end) the different Minimax Profiles I experimented with
	-Mention that the Minimax Profiles used are linked in the Repo
	-Give a link to the repo
	-Fix the Rules images' checkers to be on BLACK Cells, and emphasize that they are on BLACK cells
	-Discuss in the dissertation that Depth 5 was used - the risk of Depth 10 being too slow came true, so Depth 5
	was used instead for all experiments with Class 2.
	-Once the analysis is complete, don't forget the abstract

Experimental Setup:
	-Mention that experiments in Excel Spreadsheet were not "Re-Run")
	-Clarify that, for Minimax, "By Utility" sorting means in DESCENDING order of Utility
	
	Preliminary Experiment:
		-Mention that base Minimax Profile has 5000ms Timeout, which is constant
		-Mention that a preliminary experiment was done for depth cutoff and sorting, but it was decided to redo it due to
		lacking any useful metrics besides no. wins and draws. Furthermore, abysmal performance was found, particularly as the Guerilla,
		so a new avenue of experimentation was decided upon - Turn lookahead.
		-Then a smaller (10 games rather than 100) experiment was done with Turn-based Lookahead,
		and Guerilla performance remained abysmal
	Pre-Tuning Experiment:
		-More Metrics:
			1. Type of COIN Victories (by Guerilla Running out of Pieces or COIN Capturing all pieces)
			2. Avg no. Turns per game, per COIN Victory, per Guerilla Victory, per Draw
		-Added measures of how long Tournament took to run as measure of performance
		-Mention my Hardware Specifications when discussing running the experiment
		-A major issue found was that the Guerilla Player was at a disadvantage - their
		placement of pieces counts as TWO separate moves, which uses up 2 plies of the
		search tree, meaning it can look into the COIN's Player moves less, and thus be
		less performant
		-Therefore, the implementation was changed - the placement of Two Guerilla Pieces
		counts as ONE Move
		-Discuss Optimization of different order placement of pieces into same position 
		and how that decreased searches
		-Discuss Further Insights from the game itself that were gained:
			-It is of great use to place pieces in corners between two COIN Checkers.
			This was implied by not counting Pieces between Checkers as threatened, but from
			own playing was an important step in winning (especially in the early game, when COIN
			checkers are bunched up), so was incentivized as its own Evaluation Parameter,
			different from the starting ones.
			-It is of great use to "block off" movements of COIN Checkers, so for this
			a new evaluation function was created for Minimax
		-Discuss Major Minimax Issue that was fixed
	Post-Tuning Experiment:
		-Mention additional metrics devised:
			1. No. COIN Checkers left in Draw and COIN Victory
			2. Mean Branching Factor for COIN and Guerilla
		-Mention the creation of Python Scripts to analyze Data from txts

Analysis:
	-Discuss mean branching factor for COIN and Guerilla - there was no data about this
	when research was being done, now it is known experimentally.
	-Discuss Performance difference (time took to run) pre and post-tuning

_______________________________________

1 – Abstract
1.	Extend on the nature of the game (2 players, asymmetric, one side COIN playing by rules similar to Checkers, another the Guerilla, playing in corners)
2.	Explain my rationale – why am I doing this project?
3.	Give the context of the project – briefly discuss GDScript, and why I chose a desktop project (more power & memory)
4.	Explain what the Customizable Evaluation Function is

2 – Background
1.	When discussing the rules, mention that Guerilla Checkers is turn-based, with the two sides alternating Turns, the Guerilla Player going first
2.	It’s not a corner of the board that pieces are placed on, it’s the intersection of 2 lines on the board
3.	“Game ending criteria” – reword that to “Victory Conditions”
4.	Discuss all characteristics – not just asymmetric, also turn-based, zero-sum, deterministic and perfect-information games
5.	When talking about Game State being particular configuration of the game, emphasize that the full state of the world is visible
6.	Mention the evaluation function (i.e., expand in Russell, Norvig that most games’ minimax trees are too deep to choose a move that wins the game, so instead an evaluation function has to 	be used, and the maximizer needs to maximize it, and minimizer minimize)
7.	Remove the point about Neural Networks for why Minimax is best
8.	For the “Performance can be improved by up to 50%”, cite Russell and Norvig right after the 50%
9.	At some point discuss why studying Minimax for a game like Guerilla Checkers is of general interest
10.	Remove “Issues of Minimax Performance” section, (and the Allis in 1994 reference), expanding on Point 6 instead – also, explain how and why the search tree being cut off is good – in a 	recursive function, have an argument that is subtracted by 1 each time, when it reaches 0, return, good because it reduces number of searches
11.	Explain why Alpha-Beta Pruning increases performance by up to a Factor of 2
12.	Shorten discussion of Markov Decision Processes, and Value and Policy Iteration
13.	For “lack of literature” (if I keep that part) – elaborate “lack of data on optimal moves and strategies for Guerilla Checkers in particular”
14.	Expand on Active Reinforcement learning – “how to operate well in it.” – in the context of Guerilla Checkers
15.	“Guerilla Checkers” is a complex game – more nuance – “While Guerilla Checkers has a short ruleset, they still give rise to many unique scenarios, particularly in later turns of the game, 	making it less likely for Reinforcement learning to…”
16.	Have picture for a Neural Network 
17.	Emphasize that a Neural Network is evolved genetically, not a Genetic Algorithm being used
18.	Emphasize that there are no datasets for good moves in Guerilla Checkers
19.	I lack authoritative references, particularly on AI techniques – need to have some more to cite, perhaps

3 – Requirements Analysis
1.	For FR-2, link to the Rules-Based AI in the corresponding section
2.	For FR-3, I should reword it better – the Parameters are Tunable, not adjustable, and each tunable parameter should be separate, with a link to the corresponding Non-Functional Requirement
3.	Reword NFR-6 to “The System shall provide visual feedback to the User about the opponent’s actions” through animations
4.	Reword NFR-7 to “The System shall provide visual feedback to the User”, not them “Understanding” how things work
5.	Somewhere in Project Management, discuss why I chose GitHub in particular to store my project on
6.	For NFR-17, clarify that it is sorting of moves, and that it’s not future moves, but possible moves

4 – Design of the Rules-Based Computer Player
1.	Add a short introduction paragraph to discuss the Rules of this AI
