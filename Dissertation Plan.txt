Experimental Setup:
	-Mention that experiments in Excel Spreadsheet were not "Re-Run")
	-Mention that the Process was "Realtime Priority" in Windows
	-Mention my Hardware Specifications when discussing running the experiment

Analysis:
	-Discuss mean branching factor for COIN and Guerilla - there was no data about this
	when research was being done, now it is known experimentally.
	-Discuss Performance difference (time took to run) pre and post-tuning

General:
	-Add page numbers
	-Upload into the repo (at the end) the different Minimax Profiles I experimented with
	-Mention that the Minimax Profiles used are linked in the Repo
	-Give a link to the repo
	-Discuss in the dissertation that Depth 5 was used - the risk of Depth 10 being too slow came true, so Depth 5
	was used instead for all experiments with Class 2.
	-Once the analysis is complete, don't forget the abstract
	-Once everything is complete, make the links more concrete (e.g. not just "Section 7" for UCP, but e.g. "Section 7.3")
		(In Requirements)
	-Make the References align normally
	-Check the Handbook to see if everything matches

1 – Abstract
1. Extend on the nature of the game (2 players, asymmetric, one side COIN playing by rules similar to Checkers, another the Guerilla, playing in corners)
2. Explain my rationale – why am I doing this project?
3. Give the context of the project – briefly discuss GDScript, and why I chose a desktop project (more power & memory)
4. Explain what the Customizable Evaluation Function is

2 – Background
1. When discussing the rules, mention that Guerilla Checkers is turn-based, with the two sides alternating Turns, the Guerilla Player going first
2. It’s not a corner of the board that pieces are placed on, it’s the intersection of 2 lines on the board
3. “Game ending criteria” – reword that to “Victory Conditions”
4. Discuss all characteristics – not just asymmetric, also turn-based, zero-sum, deterministic and perfect-information games
5. When talking about Game State being particular configuration of the game, emphasize that the full state of the world is visible
6. Mention the evaluation function (i.e., expand in Russell, Norvig that most games’ minimax trees are too deep to choose a move that wins the game, 
so instead an evaluation function has to be used, and the maximizer needs to maximize it, and minimizer minimize)
7. Remove the point about Neural Networks for why Minimax is best
8. For the “Performance can be improved by up to 50%”, cite Russell and Norvig right after the 50%
9. At some point discuss why studying Minimax for a game like Guerilla Checkers is of general interest
10. Remove “Issues of Minimax Performance” section, (and the Allis in 1994 reference), expanding on Point 6 instead – also, explain how and why the search tree being cut off is good – in a 	recursive function, have an argument that is subtracted by 1 each time, when it reaches 0, return, good because it reduces number of searches
11. Explain why Alpha-Beta Pruning increases performance by up to a Factor of 2
12. Shorten discussion of Markov Decision Processes, and Value and Policy Iteration
13. For “lack of literature” (if I keep that part) – elaborate “lack of data on optimal moves and strategies for Guerilla Checkers in particular”
14. Expand on Active Reinforcement learning – “how to operate well in it.” – in the context of Guerilla Checkers
15. “Guerilla Checkers” is a complex game – more nuance – “While Guerilla Checkers has a short ruleset, they still give rise to many unique scenarios, particularly in later turns of the game, 	making it less likely for Reinforcement learning to…”
16. Have picture for a Neural Network 
17. Emphasize that a Neural Network is evolved genetically, not a Genetic Algorithm being used
18. Emphasize that there are no datasets for good moves in Guerilla Checkers
19. I lack authoritative references, particularly on AI techniques – need to have some more to cite, perhaps
